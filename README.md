Create a .env file in the root directory and structure the variables according to the .example.env file.

For example, if the smart contract has been deployed on the Sepolia network, the contract address and Price V3 address will be logged in the console. Copy these addresses and store them in the .env file as shown in the .example.env file:

VITE_SEPOLIA_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="Sepolia deployment address"
VITE_SEPOLIA_PRICE_V3_ADDRESS="Sepolia price feed deployment address"
